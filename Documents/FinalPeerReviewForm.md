### This for intends to provide feedback for the ENTIRE project from start to now. 

**Name:** Andrew **Report to Review:** All project information up to this point

## Criteria

### Content

| Criteria | Goal for 100% | Substantial Qualitative Feedback |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **How to Create and Apply Testing Methods** | Discussion of agile development is comprehensive, detailed, and complete. Discussion is appropriately at an enterprise level. | The five phases of the Agile development life cycle—Concept, Inception, Iteration/Increment, Release, and Maintenance—have been well implemented in CineScope. Conceptual planning established project goals and scope, while Inception involved setting up the Blazor component structure and database schema. Iteration has focused on refining UI/UX through continuous feedback, including the feedback that we recieved from other groups during class. Release and Maintenance will ensure quality control, incorporating automated testing strategies. Our website has been successfully deployed and we'll focus on both updating it and keeping it online|
| **How to Evaluate the Quality of a Project** | Discussion of quality evaluation is comprehensive, detailed, and complete. Discussion is connected to implications for the project moving forward. | A quantitative way to measure the quality of our app is through the following  [charts](https://github.com/omniV1/CineScope/blob/main/Documents/Sprint1-Charts.md). These charts display progress in issue resolution, code coverage from unit tests, and feature completion. The tracking of MongoDB query performance and Blazor UI responsiveness also plays a role in ensuring overall quality. |

### Organization and Effectiveness

| Criteria | Goal for 100% | Substantial Qualitative Feedback |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Thesis Development and Purpose** | Thesis and/or main claim are comprehensive; contained within the thesis is the essence of the paper. Thesis statement makes the purpose of the paper clear. |With MongoDB successfully integrated and the website deployed, CineScope's component-based Blazor architecture provides a responsive user experience through client-side caching while ensuring content moderation through effective server-side filtering. Performance optimizations and security measures have been implemented to support scalability and maintain a smooth user experience.|
| **Paragraph Development and Transitions** | There is a sophisticated construction of paragraphs and transitions. Ideas progress and relate to each other. Paragraph and transition construction guide the reader. Paragraph structure is seamless. | Various documentation sources have been referenced throughout development, including API documentation for Blazor, MongoDB schema design best practices, and component-based UI principles. Additionally, sprint retrospectives provide structured insights into development challenges and improvements. The documentation also details deployment steps and ongoing monitoring procedures. |
| **Mechanics of Writing** (includes spelling, punctuation, grammar, language use) | Writer is clearly in command of standard, written, academic English. | Markdown has been used to format documentation, ensuring readability and consistency. Our documentation process includes README files for setup instructions, API reference documentation, sprint reports, and deployment guides. Code comments follow industry best practices, making maintenance and future development more efficient. Tools from Atlassian such as Confluence and Jira have also been key in maintaining organization and up-to-date documentation |
