**Name:** Carter **Report to Review:** All project information up to this point

## Criteria

### Content

| Criteria | Goal for 100% | Substantial Qualitative Feedback |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **How to Create and Apply Testing Methods** | Discussion of agile development is comprehensive, detailed, and complete. Discussion is appropriately at an enterprise level. | The five phases of the Agile development life cycle—Concept, Inception, Iteration/Increment, Release, and Maintenance—have been well implemented in CineScope. Conceptual planning established project goals and scope, while Inception involved setting up the Blazor component structure and database schema. Iteration has focused on refining UI/UX through continuous feedback, including the feedback that we recieved from other groups during class. Release and Maintenance will ensure quality control, incorporating automated testing strategies. Our website has been successfully deployed and we'll focus on both updating it and keeping it online|
| **How to Evaluate the Quality of a Project** | Discussion of quality evaluation is comprehensive, detailed, and complete. Discussion is connected to implications for the project moving forward. | The Agile Development Progress Report provides key insights into our development progress. The Sprint Burndown Chart shows we stayed on track, while the Cumulative Flow Diagram indicates steady productivity. User Satisfaction Ratings highlight strengths in authentication (8.5/10) but suggest UI improvements (7.0/10). Velocity by Feature Area reflects shifting priorities, with backend work peaking in Week 3. Task Completion data confirms mostly accurate estimations, though some inconsistencies remain. The investment in authentication paid off with high satisfaction. These findings support recommendations for UI enhancements, workload balancing, and refined estimation processes.|

### Organization and Effectiveness

| Criteria | Goal for 100% | Substantial Qualitative Feedback |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Thesis Development and Purpose** | Thesis and/or main claim are comprehensive; contained within the thesis is the essence of the paper. Thesis statement makes the purpose of the paper clear. |With MongoDB successfully integrated and the website deployed, CineScope's component-based Blazor architecture provides a responsive user experience through client-side caching while ensuring content moderation through effective server-side filtering. Performance optimizations and security measures have been implemented to support scalability and maintain a smooth user experience.|
| **Paragraph Development and Transitions** | There is a sophisticated construction of paragraphs and transitions. Ideas progress and relate to each other. Paragraph and transition construction guide the reader. Paragraph structure is seamless. | [Functional Requirements Document](https://github.com/omniV1/CineScope/edit/main/Documents/FinalPeerReviewForm.md) – Outlines the system’s expected functionality and performance, detailing user needs, use cases, and architectural plans for the CineScope platform.<br>[Technical Design Document](https://github.com/omniV1/CineScope/edit/main/Documents/FinalPeerReviewForm.md) – Describes the system’s architecture, components, data flow, and UI design to guide the development of CineScope.<br>[Test Procedures Document](https://github.com/omniV1/CineScope/edit/main/Documents/FinalPeerReviewForm.md) – Defines the testing strategy, test cases, and validation criteria to ensure CineScope meets its functional and non-functional requirements.<br>[Version Description Document](https://github.com/omniV1/CineScope/edit/main/Documents/FinalPeerReviewForm.md) – Summarizes the current project status, deliverables, sprint planning, and risks for the CineScope development lifecycle. |
| **Mechanics of Writing** (includes spelling, punctuation, grammar, language use) | Writer is clearly in command of standard, written, academic English. | Markdown has been used to format documentation, ensuring readability and consistency. Our documentation process includes README files for setup instructions, API reference documentation, sprint reports, and deployment guides. Code comments follow industry best practices, making maintenance and future development more efficient. Tools from Atlassian such as Confluence and Jira have also been key in maintaining organization and up-to-date documentation |
