| ARCH-001 |  System Architecture            |     Design flaw in diagram figure 1.       |   Figure 1 created by Owen Lindsey dsiplays a deployment platform however this app has not deployed.                |     Andrew - fix this by removing the deployment square from the diagram or moving it to out of scope for sprint 2 as it is not required for sprint completion.            |
| ARCH-002 |    System Architecture              |    Documentation of N-layer requires update.         |   Our N-layer description created by Andrew Mack lacks a Server layer for our DTOs in our MongoDB.                |  Owen - Add a server layer for DTOs because we are using a mongoDB.               |
| ARCH-003 |   User Interface Design           |   Design flaw in diagram figure 3         |  Figure 3 created by Owen Lindsey landing page needs to display top rated and recently added movies.                       |Andrew -  Movies by category actually filters by search, genre, and rating and the landing page shows the most recently added and top rated movies. Update the site map to reflect this flow.               |
