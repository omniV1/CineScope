# CineScope Milestone Assignment To-Do List

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive to-do list for completing the CineScope Milestone 4 assignment, which consists of two parts:
1. An Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP)
2. A Milestone Version Description Document

---

## Part 1: Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP)

### 1. Finalize Test Procedure Document ✓
- [x] Create detailed test procedures for 5+ functional behaviors
- [x] Ensure each test includes setup, execution, and pass/fail criteria
- [x] Include screenshots/wireframes as visual references
- [x] Make sure procedures are detailed enough for others to execute
- [ ] Review for any requirement deficiencies and document them

> **Direction**: Have at least one other team member review the test procedure document to ensure completeness. Look for missing requirements or edge cases. Document any deficiencies and create corresponding backlog items.

### 2. Create Jira Test Tickets ⚠️
- [ ] Create all 10 test tickets in Jira as child tasks of user stories
- [ ] Include proper descriptions, formatting, and image references
- [ ] Link each test to appropriate implementation tasks
- [ ] Assign tickets to responsible team members
- [ ] Add the test procedure document link as a reference in tickets
- [ ] Tag all test tickets with appropriate labels (testing, QA)

> **Direction**: Follow the guide at [Test Tickets Help](https://github.com/omniV1/CineScope/blob/main/Documents/Help/test-tickets.md). Create tickets as child tasks of their respective user stories (SCRUM-19, SCRUM-27, SCRUM-34), maintaining a clean hierarchy in Jira.

### 3. Implement Test Classes in Code ⚠️
- [ ] Create test classes for each functional area
- [ ] Implement test methods matching the documented procedures
- [ ] Include assertions that match pass/fail criteria
- [ ] Ensure tests are independent and repeatable
- [ ] Add comments linking to Jira ticket IDs

> **Direction**: Create one test class per functional area (e.g., `FeaturedMoviesTests.cs`). Each test method should implement the steps from the corresponding test procedure. Use meaningful method names and include setup/teardown code.

---

## Part 2: Version Description Document

### 1. Finalize Milestone Version Description ✓
- [x] Complete all sections of the template
- [x] Include accurate project status information
- [x] Document realistic sprint metrics
- [x] Describe risk mitigation strategy for capacity management
- [x] Add supporting data for capacity management
- [x] List all milestone deliverables
- [x] Detail next steps and timeline

> **Direction**: Ensure all team members review the Version Description Document and verify that the information about their assigned tasks is correct. Pay special attention to the risk mitigation strategy section.

### 2. Document Integration ⚠️
- [ ] Ensure Version Description references the Test Procedures
- [ ] Verify cross-references between documents are accurate
- [ ] Check that all document dates and versions are consistent

> **Direction**: Follow the detailed instructions in the [Document Integration Guide](https://github.com/omniV1/CineScope/blob/main/Documents/Help/document-integration-guide.md) to add explicit references to the Test Procedures document in the Milestone Deliverables section. Ensure consistency in dates, sprint schedules, and version numbers across all documents.

## Additional Requirements

### 1. Backlog Management ⚠️
- [ ] Add issues for any requirement deficiencies found
- [ ] Prioritize new backlog items for future sprints
- [ ] Update capacity planning if new issues are added

> **Direction**: For any requirement deficiencies discovered, create new issues in the Jira backlog with appropriate priority levels. Update capacity planning if significant new work is identified.

### 2. Final Review ⚠️
- [ ] Have team members review all documents
- [ ] Verify all rubric requirements are met
- [ ] Check for formatting, grammar, and spelling issues
- [ ] Ensure all links and references work properly

> **Direction**: Schedule a team review session where each member reviews both documents. Use the assignment rubric as a checklist to ensure all requirements are met.

### 3. Submission ⚠️
- [ ] Compile final versions of both documents
- [ ] Convert to required file formats
- [ ] Submit via the specified channel by the deadline

> **Direction**: Finalize documents at least 24 hours before the deadline. Follow submission guidelines precisely, including file naming conventions.

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern
```
// Arrange: Set up the test conditions
var user = new User("testuser", "Test@123");

// Act: Perform the action being tested
bool result = authService.Authenticate(user.Username, user.Password);

// Assert: Verify the expected outcome
Assert.IsTrue(result);
```

### Test Independence
* Each test should run independently
* Don't depend on other tests' state
* Use setup/teardown for initialization

### Meaningful Assertions
* Assert exactly what you're testing
* Include descriptive error messages
* Test both positive and negative cases

## Assignment Rubric Key Points

### ATP Requirements
* At least 5 different functional behaviors tested
* Complete setup, execution, and pass/fail criteria
* Detailed enough for someone else to run
* Requirement deficiencies documented and added to backlog

### Version Description Requirements
* Complete project status information
* Sprint metrics from Agile tools and Git repository
* Strategy to mitigate excessive task allocation
* Supporting data for capacity management strategy

> **Remember**: This milestone represents a client delivery, so all documentation should be professional, accurate, and reflect the current state of the project.
